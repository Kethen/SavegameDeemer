This is the sourcecode for HELLCAT's SaveGame-Deemer

You can look at it, see how things are done, you can
make own stuff based on this.... whatever you like.

HOWEVER:
If you release something based on this, you MUST include
your source and release it under the GPL as well.

And of course: credit, where credit is due!


May the source be with you!
